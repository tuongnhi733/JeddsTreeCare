    <h2> <strong>Infestation and Damage</strong> </h2>
      <img src="images/ashborer.jpg" alt="">
<p>Borers rarely infest healthy plants growing in their natural environments. However, when trees or shrubs are transplanted into the landscape, stresses such as drought, soil compaction, sun scald, or injuries can weaken them and make them more susceptible to attack. Adults may locate suitable egg-laying sites by responding to volatile chemicals that emanate from stressed trees.
</p>
<p>Adult borers emerge from infested trees in the spring or summer. After mating, the females fly to a suitable host and lay eggs on the bark, often in crevices or around wounds. Hatching occurs about 10 days to 2 weeks later. The young larvae quickly tunnel beneath the bark where they feed and grow. Once inside the tree, borer larvae are no longer vulnerable to insecticide sprays and are seldom detected until serious damage has been done.
</p>
<p>Several species of clearwing and flatheaded borers can infest landscape plants. While some are attracted to a range of hosts, most attack only certain kinds of trees and shrubs. It is important to know when the adults of each species are active and which plants are vulnerable in order for treatment to be effective.
</p>
<h2> <strong>Clearwing Borers</strong> </h2>
<p> Adult clearwing borers are delicate, day-flying moths that resemble small wasps. The moths feed only on nectar or not at all so they do not cause damage. The larvae are whitish, hairless caterpillars with brown heads. The most damaging clearwing borers are associated with dogwood, lilac, ash, oak, rhododendron, and ornamental Prunus species, including flowering peach, plums, and cherries.
</p>
<h2> <strong>Detecting Clearwing Borers</strong> </h2>
<p>Early signs of clearwing borer infestation are wilting of terminal shoots, and branch and crown dieback. Infestation sites often are marked by cankers, calluses, or cracked bark. Large limbs may die or become so weakened that they are easily broken in the wind. Established trees may persist in poor condition and be re-infested year after year.
</p>
<p>Clearwing borers expel coarse, brown frass (sawdust-like fecal material) from cracks in the bark. In some hosts, especially Prunus species, the frass may be mixed with oozing sap or gum. When the adult moth emerges, it leaves an empty, tan shell (pupal skin) that protrudes from the bark. Feeding holes left by woodpeckers or other birds may indicate that a tree is infested.
